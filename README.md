# MEAN Stack - Super Hero Tracker

This is a full-stack application I started to keep my MEAN stack skills fresh! I used a prompt that asked to allow users to add Heroes to a database, and on a separate view be able to view/sort/delete the heroes from the database.

## Technologies Used:

- AngularJS
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express
- Bootstrap
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
